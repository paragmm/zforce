This project is a demonstration of a brute force attack on a login page with CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection. It showcases how attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to gain unauthorized access. The project includes features such as:

- Simulating brute force attacks on a login page
- Implementing CSRF protection mechanisms
- Logging and analyzing attack attempts
- Demonstrating best practices for securing login pages against such attacks

This project is intended for educational purposes to help developers understand and mitigate security risks in their applications.
